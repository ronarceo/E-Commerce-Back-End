## Installation
First, install MySQL2 and Sequelize packages Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with the MySQL database and the dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data. You will also need to create a .env file, define DB_NAME = ecommerce_db which is the name of the database, define DB_USER with your MySQL username or root, and define DB_PW with your MySQL password. 
            
## Usage
Use the schema.sql file in the db folder to create your database with MySQL shell commands. Enter npm run seed to seed data to your database with sample data.
